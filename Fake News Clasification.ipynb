    "# 📰 Fake News Detection Model - Project Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Created by:** [Glen Valencius](https://github.com/glenvj-j)  \n",
    "**Dataset Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahdimashayekhi/fake-news-detection-dataset/data)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Objective\n",
    "Develop a predictive model to classify news articles as **real** or **fake**, with a primary focus on **minimizing False Negatives**—i.e., fake news incorrectly classified as real—while also reducing False Positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Project Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal**: Build a robust classification model to detect fake news articles.\n",
    "- **Features Used**:\n",
    "  - 📝 **Text Data**: `title`, `text`\n",
    "  - 🧾 **Categorical Data**: `source`, `author`, `category`\n",
    "  - 📆 **Date Information**: `month`, `day`, `year` (included as remainder or engineered further)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Feature Engineering Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔤 **Text Vectorization**:\n",
    "  - Apply `TfidfVectorizer` on `title` and `text` to extract important terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🧩 **Categorical Encoding**:\n",
    "  - Use **One-Hot Encoding** for `source` and `category`.\n",
    "  - Apply **Binary or Ordinal Encoding** to `author` depending on cardinality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📐 **Numerical Features**:\n",
    "  - Scale numerical values like word counts using `RobustScaler`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📅 **Date Fields**:\n",
    "  - Include `month`, `day`, and `year` as is, or transform based on date patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Modeling Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Focus on reducing **False Negatives (FN)** more heavily due to the high cost of misclassifying fake news as real.\n",
    "- Also minimize **False Positives (FP)** to ensure reliability.\n",
    "- Evaluation metrics will include:\n",
    "  - **F2 Score** (heavier penalty on FN)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Disclaimer\n",
    "> This dataset has been synthetically generated to closely resemble real-world news content. While suitable for modeling and experimentation, the results should be validated on real data before any production deployment.\n"

    "> **Disclaimer**: This dataset has been synthetically generated to closely resemble real news articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Key Insights from Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 📏 **Text Length**: The number of words in fake news articles is slightly shorter than in real news, though the difference is not significant.\n",
    "2. ✍️ **Top Fake News Authors**: The most frequent authors of fake news articles include:\n",
    "   - James Smith  \n",
    "   - Christopher Johnson  \n",
    "   - John Brown  \n",
    "   - Michael Williams  \n",
    "   - David Garcia\n",
    "3. 📰 **Media Sources**: The media outlets most associated with fake news are:\n",
    "   - Daily News  \n",
    "   - NY Times  \n",
    "   - CNN\n",
    "4. 📅 **Publication Date**: The majority of fake news articles were published in **November 2022**.\n",
    "5. 🧠 **Common Words in Fake News**: Frequently used words include **“summer”**, **“moment”**, and **“wide”**—suggesting the need for deeper semantic/contextual analysis in the future.\n",
    "6. 🗂️ **Category Distribution**: Fake news articles are most commonly found in the **Health**, **Business**, and **Entertainment** categories. However, the difference in distribution across categories is not substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Modeling Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ A classification model was successfully built using **Logistic Regression**.\n",
    "- 📊 On the test dataset, the model achieved an **F2 Score of 0.6935**, indicating a reasonable balance between **recall** and **precision**, with an emphasis on reducing **false negatives**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates the potential of using basic NLP techniques and structured metadata to effectively detect fake news articles.\n"

    "## 🚀 Future Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance the accuracy and reliability of the fake news detection model, the following improvements are recommended:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Real News Articles**  \n",
    "   Shift from synthetic datasets to real-world news snippets to better capture the complexity, tone, and context of genuine and fake news content.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Leverage More Advanced Models (e.g., Keras / Deep Learning)**  \n",
    "   Incorporate deep learning approaches such as neural networks (e.g., LSTM, BERT, or CNN models via Keras or TensorFlow) to better capture semantic patterns and contextual relationships in text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Improve Semantic Understanding**  \n",
    "   Use more advanced NLP techniques like word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT) or sentence transformers to go beyond simple bag-of-words. This helps the model grasp the **real meaning** behind sentences and better handle nuances in language.\n",
    "\n",
    "These enhancements will help reduce misclassifications and improve the model’s robustness in real-world applications.\n"
